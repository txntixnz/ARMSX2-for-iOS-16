// ABI-digest guard — the #1 corruption backstop for the persisted-JIT VU
// program cache.
//
// The on-disk cache trusts kMvuCompilerAbiVersion (mixed into the VERSION
// handshake) to mean "the emitters that produced a .vuprog are the emitters
// running now." An emitter change WITHOUT an ABI bump silently runs stale
// code shapes hydrated from disk — the payload checksum can't see it (the
// bytes match what was saved; it's the saver that changed). This test pins
// the emitted SHAPE per ABI version so that drift fails loudly at commit
// time instead.
//
// The digest (mVUPersist::TestComputeEmitDigest) masks every operand that
// may legitimately differ between correct emissions — 64-bit mov-chain
// immediates, B/BL displacements, ADRP pages, fixup address payloads — and
// hashes what remains: opcode selection, register allocation, instruction
// order, block/chunk/fixup structure. That is deterministic across runs,
// machines, and PIE/ASLR.
//
// WHEN THIS TEST GOES RED:
//   1. You changed mVU codegen (any microVU_*-arm64 emit path, AsmHelpers
//      canonical forms, the serializer layout): bump kMvuCompilerAbiVersion
//      in microVU-arm64.h (+ the mirror in mvu_progcache_versioning_tests),
//      then add the new {abi, digests} row below. The bump evicts every
//      stale on-disk cache — that's the point.
//   2. You changed a default config value that alters emitted forms (clamp
//      mode etc.): the options sentinel already evicts those caches; just
//      re-pin the digests here (no ABI bump needed).
//   Never "fix" this test by re-pinning without deciding which case you
//   are in.
//
// Recording is enabled during compilation because the cache only ever
// stores recording-enabled forms (canonical movs, forced-long cond
// branches) — those are the shapes worth pinning.
