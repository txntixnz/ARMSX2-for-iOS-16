/// Version number for GS and other shaders. Increment whenever any of the contents of the
/// shaders change, to invalidate the cache.
// 109: driver-workaround shader wrappers (gpu_bitwise_and / gpu_bitwise_not / gpu_boolean_not /
// gpu_matrix_element). Every TFX and convert shader's source text changed, so a cached blob from
// 108 no longer matches the source that produced it — leaving this alone hands users stale
// binaries and garbage rendering after the update.
// 110: Vulkan emits the gpu_bitwise_and / gpu_matrix_element wrappers as bare #defines when no
// driver workaround is active, so unaffected drivers get the same SPIR-V they had at 108. 109 wrapped
// them in real functions on EVERY driver, and Qualcomm's SPIR-V compiler segfaults compiling a TFX
// pipeline containing those calls.
// 111: the 2026-08 upstream sync drops the unused SW_DEPTH term from the Vulkan TFX ZWRITE
// condition, changing that shader's source text. ⚠️ Upstream numbered the same change 109, which
// is BELOW our 110 — taking their value would hand every user a stale blob for a source they no
// longer have. Our counter has been ahead of theirs since 109 and cannot be resynced by adopting
// their numbers; always bump past our own last value.
// 112: PS_QUANTIZE_COLOR. Every TFX shader gains the define and the colour-clamp block's guard
// gains a term, so the source text of every TFX permutation changed.
// 113: PS_SUBSTITUTE_ALPHA. Every TFX shader gains the define, two constant-buffer pad words
// become named fields, and the colour-clamp block's guard gains another term.
// 114: PS_AF_IN_SRC1. The Vulkan TFX shader gains the define and a block that overrides
// alpha_blend with the fixed AFIX value, so its source text changed after 113 was set.
// 115: upstream PR 14897, the depth conversion shaders floor the bilinear result.
// 116: upstream PR 14824, the PrimID DATE init shaders take PRIMID_MIN/MAX defines.
// 117: upstream PR 14743, ps_fbmask reads the destination alpha in the RTA-scaled domain and
// ROV channel masking goes through FBMASK.
// 118-123: tfx.* tests scan-mask field parity on the native line, indexes the dither matrix by the
// native pixel under a per-axis phase the CPU picks (the PS constant buffer's last pad is named for
// it), and gains PS_NATIVE_TEXEL_GRID so a nearest sprite minifying a GS-memory texture reads its
// native pixel's texel (one more PS constant-buffer vector). interlace.* still tests field parity
// on the device row; its constant buffer's second vector carries the undrawn top band.
// 124: the TFX dither index and scan-mask test divide by the render target's scale, carried in the
// PS constant buffer's former pad after RcpScaleFactor, instead of the texture's.
// 125: the weave and MAD buffering passes fill the undrawn field band where the display rect
// starts, read from FieldPad.xy as a row range, instead of from row 0 down to a row count.
// 126: the 2026-09 upstream sync: the AA1 triangle-expand vertex shaders, the tfx type-mismatch fixes,
// the software-blend shuffle denormalize, and the GL gpu_shader5 removal change shader
// source text. Upstream numbered their last of these 118.
// 127: a sprite whose far edge the pixel-grid snap pushed out samples no further than its last
// native pixel, so tfx.glsl (Vulkan) gains VS_SPRITE_EDGE_CLAMP and PS_SPRITE_EDGE_CLAMP.
// 128: every backend's tfx shader gains PS_REPLACEMENT_ALPHA_SNAP (pack texture alpha near 0x80).
