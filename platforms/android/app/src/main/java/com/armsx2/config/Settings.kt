/**
 * Resolved emulator config used to drive a VM launch / live-apply.
 *
 * Field naming convention: each field comments the upstream
 * `<section>/<key>` it maps to (grep against pcsx2 docs / Pcsx2Config.cpp).
 *
 * Settings are pushed via [applyTo] which calls NativeApp.setSetting per
 * field, then a single NativeApp.commitSettings to push the queued writes
 * into the running VM (or persist them for the next launch).
 *
 * Settings holds one nested data class per section (CpuSettings, GraphicsSettings and so on),
 * because a Kotlin data class stops working on Android at around 245 fields; SettingsSizeTest
 * says why and fails before any class gets there. The JSON keys stay flat ("renderer", not
 * "graphics.renderer"), so the nesting is invisible to stored settings and per-game overrides.
 *
 * Adding a new setting:
 *   1. Add a field, with an upstream-matching default, to its section's class,
 *   2. Add a setSetting line in applyTo,
 *   3. Add the JSON mapping in toJson + fromJson + diff + merge,
 *   4. Surface a widget in the appropriate Settings tab.
