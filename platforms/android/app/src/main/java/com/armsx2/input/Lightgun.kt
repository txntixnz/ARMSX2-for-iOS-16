/**
 * GunCon 2 lightgun, aimed with the touchscreen.
 *
 * The core already emulates the device (`usb_lightgun::GunCon2Device`, `DEVTYPE_GUNCON2`). This is
 * the Android half: it decides which USB port carries it, converts a touch into an aim, and turns
 * taps into trigger pulls.
 *
 * Why the touchscreen rather than a real gun: a CRT lightgun works by timing the scanline sweep,
 * which no LCD reproduces, so every modern lightgun setup is really "a pointing device pretending
 * to be one". A finger is a perfectly good pointing device, and it is the one every phone has.
 *
 * ★ The device type is RESTART-REQUIRED. Swapping a USB device on a live VM is the emulated
 * equivalent of yanking the plug mid-poll: the game has already probed the port and cached what it
 * found. The setting is written immediately so the next boot picks it up.
